# Redux Essentials Tutorial Example

This project contains the setup and code from the "Redux Essentials" tutorial example app in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-3-data-flow ).

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and is based on the [official Redux Toolkit + Vite template](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates/tree/master/packages/vite-template-redux).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
